# Bank Innovation Score Metric

**Group Members:**
* Justin Dorval
* George Whittington

## Description

This project uses the "combined annual bank data" dataset, which was created by parsing Edgar 10-K, 10-Q, and FFEIC call report data for banks from 2010 to 2021. The goal is to analyze this data to develop a metric for bank innovation.

## Key Questions

1. Which variables are important to Innovation in banking?
2. Can we find a combination of these variables that properly fits a set of pre-determined Innovation banks and create a score?
3. Can these variables predict Year over Year change in Innovation or when a bank is ramping up Innovation production?

## Deliverables

* **Project Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the project's background, methodology, implementation, results, analysis, and conclusions.
* **Oral Presentation Slides:** A slide deck summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
* **Code File:** A QMD/IPYNB file that contains the code for all models and related tasks.
